        -> Do revise about fast input and output

        -> Do this problem later Find n-th lexicographically permutation of a string 

        -> Leaving Graph and DP problems like a pro and Binary search problem as well imto se karna binary search 

        -> In kadane init maxGlobal and maxCurrent with first element, write corner cases for array size 0 and 1 and maxGlobal should be checked everytime.

        -> Checking binary tree for BST is a bit confusing, We are going top to bottom think your approach like that only.

        -> Searching in rotated sorted array is a bit confusing as well, find the pivot than decide which side the searching element is going to be there and search normally

        -> in Flattening a Linked list I was literally clue less , do this one more time 

        -> Move all zeros to end while retaining the order as well of array

        -> Odd Even Linked List or say (Rearrange a linked list such that all even and odd positioned nodes are together) is very confusing question gotta do it properly man there are 2 approach for that , 
            -> in first aproach end position pointer and start position pointer, 
                    end->next -> start->next;
                    start -> start->next->next;
                    end->next->next =NULL

                    start = start->next;
                    end=end=end->next;

                    run this till floor(no_of_nodes/2)
            ->  I have to see the second approach;

        -> Two numbers with sum closest to zero is not just sort and get ans by firstTwo, lastTwo and firstlast, it is much more than that;
                        -> sort, 
                        -> start Pointer and end pointer 
                        -> sum=a[start]+ a[end]
                        -> if su  is -ve , start++
                        ->if sum is +ve, end--
                        ->keep track of abs min 
                        -> till start < end

        -> Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion, use bubble sort and flag

        -> celebraity problem in O(n) time and O(1) space please

        -> Merge two sorted I nee to do a inplace sorting not using extra space

        -> Leaves to DLL is tuff problem definately
